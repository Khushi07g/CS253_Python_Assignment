## Introduction

This Jupyter Notebook (`main.ipynb`) presents a data analysis and machine learning approach to predict the education levels of Indian political candidates. The prediction is based on various features such as party affiliation, financial status (total assets and liabilities), constituency information, and candidate details.
The notebook includes data preprocessing steps, exploratory data analysis, model training using the Random Forest Classifier, evaluation of the model's performance, and making predictions on the test dataset. Additionally, visualization techniques are employed to gain insights into the relationships between different features and the target variable (education level).
